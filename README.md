# Department Charts

## Description
In this challenge I used mysql to create a database. Inside this database I created tables for departments, jobs and employees and setup their relationship to eachother. Using Inquirer I made prompts that ask the user which collection they would like to view in the database or which collection the would like to make an addition to.

## Usage
The user can enter node server.js into the terminal to access a list of options to view or add to a collection in the database. Once the user selects an option the program will start again so the user can make another selection. When the user is ready to exit the program they can select the exit option to quit the program.
